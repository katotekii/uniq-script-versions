- Fixed not showing impound and dealership when restarting script
- Functions `GiveCarKeys` & `RemoveCarKeys` are moved to `client/editable.lua`
- Improved logic for spawning and deleting vehicles
- Command `/setgang` is removed to reduce confusion, you always use `/uisetgang` no matter which `setJobField` you use
